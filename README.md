## Improvements

Currently there is an improved logging with new options to set log
limit. It means that it allows custom log size and also fixes
various issues with wrapping. The feature is in the final stage
of the development which means that it is working and just needs
some final testing, fixes and performance optimisations. Further 
details will be available once completely finished.
